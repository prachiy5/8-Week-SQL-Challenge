# Reporting Challenge üìä

This section consolidates all the queries from **High-Level Sales Analysis** and **Transaction Analysis** into a single SQL script. The goal is to generate a scheduled report for the previous month‚Äôs data, allowing the Balanced Tree team to review key metrics effectively.

---

## High-Level Sales Analysis üî¢

### SQL Script:
```sql
-- Declare variables for the reporting period
DECLARE @start_date DATE = '2021-01-01'; -- Adjust for the first day of the month
DECLARE @end_date DATE = '2021-01-31';   -- Adjust for the last day of the month

-- 1. What was the total quantity sold for all products?
SELECT SUM(qty) AS total_quantity
FROM sales
WHERE start_txn_time BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date;

-- 2. What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?
SELECT SUM(qty * price) AS total_revenue
FROM sales
WHERE start_txn_time BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date
  AND qty IS NOT NULL 
  AND price IS NOT NULL;

-- 3. What was the total discount amount for all products?
SELECT CAST(ROUND(SUM(qty * price * discount / 100.0), 2) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS total_discount_amount
FROM sales
WHERE start_txn_time BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date;
```

### Insights:
- **Total Quantity Sold:** Aggregates all product quantities sold within the reporting period.
- **Total Revenue:** Reflects the revenue generated before applying any discounts.
- **Total Discount Amount:** Summarizes the value of all discounts applied during the reporting period.

## Transaction Analysis üìä

### SQL Script:
```sql
-- 1. How many unique transactions were there?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS unique_transactions
FROM sales
WHERE start_txn_time BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date;

-- 2. What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT txn_id, COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS products_per_txn
    FROM sales
    WHERE start_txn_time BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date
    GROUP BY txn_id
)
SELECT AVG(products_per_txn) AS avg_unique_products
FROM cte;

-- 3. What are the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT txn_id, SUM(price * qty) AS revenue
    FROM sales
    WHERE start_txn_time BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date
    GROUP BY txn_id
)
SELECT DISTINCT
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) OVER () AS percentile_25,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.50) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) OVER () AS percentile_50,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) OVER () AS percentile_75
FROM cte;

-- 4. What is the average discount value per transaction?
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT txn_id, SUM(qty * price * CAST(discount AS NUMERIC) / 100) AS discount_per_transaction
    FROM sales
    WHERE start_txn_time BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date
    GROUP BY txn_id
)
SELECT CAST(ROUND(AVG(discount_per_transaction), 2) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS avg_discount_value
FROM cte;

-- 5. What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT member, COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS txns
    FROM sales
    WHERE start_txn_time BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date
    GROUP BY member
)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN member = 0 THEN 'Not a Member' 
        WHEN member = 1 THEN 'Is a Member'
    END AS member_status,
    100.0 * CAST(txns AS FLOAT) / 
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) FROM sales WHERE start_txn_time BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date) AS percentage_split
FROM cte;

-- 6. What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT txn_id, member, SUM(qty * price) AS revenue
    FROM sales
    WHERE start_txn_time BETWEEN @start_date AND @end_date
    GROUP BY txn_id, member
)
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN member = 0 THEN 'Not a Member' 
        WHEN member = 1 THEN 'Is a Member'
    END AS member_status,
    AVG(revenue) AS avg_revenue
FROM cte
GROUP BY member;
```

### Insights:
- **Unique Transactions:** Tracks the count of distinct transactions in the reporting period.
- **Average Unique Products:** Evaluates the diversity of purchases per transaction.
- **Revenue Percentiles:** Highlights key revenue distribution metrics (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles).
- **Average Discount Value:** Summarizes the discount value per transaction.
- **Member vs Non-Member:** Analyzes transaction contributions and revenue patterns for both groups.

### üìä Instructions for Running and Automating the Report

- üóìÔ∏è Use `@start_date` and `@end_date` variables to set the reporting period for the desired month. Update these dates before running the script.

- üìÅ The script is divided into sections like **High-Level Sales Analysis**, **Transaction Analysis**, and **Product Analysis**. Each section calculates specific metrics.

- ü§ñ To automate the script, schedule it using SQL Job Scheduler or similar tools. Set the job to run at the start of each month for the previous month‚Äôs data.

- ‚úÖ Validate the results for a few months manually before scheduling the script. This ensures accuracy in outputs like percentiles and aggregations.

- üìù Store the output of each section in separate tables for record-keeping and future reference. Create a summary table for quick executive review.

- üîÅ The script is designed to be reusable. To analyze a different month, just update the date variables.

- üí¨ Before finalizing the report, get feedback from stakeholders (e.g., the CFO or merchandising team) to ensure the metrics meet their expectations.

- ‚öôÔ∏è Check the database for proper indexing on key tables like `sales` and `product_details` to optimize script performance.

- üìà Use the outputs to track trends over time and identify areas for business improvements.

- üîÑ Run the script periodically to keep the metrics up-to-date and relevant.
