### 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

To calculate the rate of growth, I would:
1. **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: Count the number of active customers (non-churned) each month.
2. **Customer Growth Rate**:
   - Use the formula:  
    Growth Rate (%) = [(New Customers This Month - Churned Customers This Month) / Total Customers Last Month] Ã— 100
3. **Revenue Growth Rate**:
   - Compare monthly revenue changes:  
    Revenue Growth Rate (%) = [(Revenue This Month - Revenue Last Month) / Revenue Last Month] Ã— 100

4. Track trends across different subscription plans (e.g., `basic monthly`, `pro annual`) to identify which plans drive growth.

Key metrics include:
- **Customer Metrics**:
  - Total active customers. (The number of customers currently subscribed to any plan.)
  - Customer churn rate. ( The percentage of customers who cancel their subscription over a period of time.)
  - Customer lifetime value (CLV). (The total revenue a customer is expected to generate during their subscription lifecycle.)
  - Customer acquisition cost (CAC). (The cost of acquiring a new customer through marketing and sales efforts.)
    
- **Financial Metrics**:
  - Monthly recurring revenue (MRR). (The total predictable revenue generated from subscriptions each month.)
  - Annual recurring revenue (ARR).(The yearly equivalent of monthly recurring revenue.)
  - Average revenue per user (ARPU). (The average revenue generated per customer over a specific period.)
    
- **Engagement Metrics**:
  - Plan upgrades/downgrades. (The number of customers moving to higher or lower-tier plans.)
  - Monthly login or activity rate.(The percentage of customers actively using the service each month.)
  - Content consumption rate (e.g., videos watched per customer). ( The amount of content (e.g., videos) consumed per customer over a period.)
    
- **Retention Metrics**:
  - Trial-to-paid conversion rate. (The percentage of trial users who convert to paid subscriptions.)
  - Time to first upgrade. (The average time it takes for a customer to upgrade from their initial plan to a higher-tier plan.)

### 3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?

Key journeys to analyze:
1. **Trial-to-Paid Conversion**:
   - Examine why some customers transition from trial to paid plans while others churn.
   - Identify factors influencing upgrades to `pro monthly` or `pro annual`.
   
2. **Plan Downgrades**:
   - Investigate why customers downgrade (e.g., from `pro monthly` to `basic monthly`).
   - Assess if pricing or perceived value is a driver.

3. **Churned Customers**:
   - Study the last few interactions or behaviors before churn to identify patterns or pain points.
   - Check for commonalities like usage drop-off or dissatisfaction.

4. **High-Lifetime Customers**:
   - Analyze the behavior of long-term customers to understand what drives loyalty.
   - Use findings to replicate successful experiences for other users.

   - Options: Too expensive, no longer interested, limited content, switching to competitors, other.
2. **Content Feedback**:

3. **Feature Feedback**:
