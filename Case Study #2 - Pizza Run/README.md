## üõ† Introduction

Danny launched **Pizza Runner**, a retro-styled pizza delivery service, combining Uber-like delivery with delicious pizza options. To optimize operations and direct his runners efficiently, Danny collected extensive data but needs help with data cleaning, analysis, and insights.

This case study includes many SQL challenges to solve and analyze Pizza Runner‚Äôs data.

## üßπ Data Cleaning Approach

### Why Clean the Data?
The raw data contains issues such as:
- `NULL` or invalid values in critical columns (`exclusions`, `extras`, `distance`, etc.).
- Inconsistent formatting (`km`, `minutes`, etc.).
- Duplicate or repeated records.

### How Was the Data Cleaned?

#### 1. **`customer_orders` Table**
- **Cleaned Columns**:
  - `exclusions` and `extras`: Replaced `NULL` and invalid strings (`'null'`) with blank space (`' '`).
- **Removed Duplicates**:
  - Ensured no duplicate `order_id` rows exist.

#### 2. **`runner_orders` Table**
- **Cleaned Columns**:
  - `pickup_time`: Replaced `NULL` and invalid strings (`'null'`) with blank space (`' '`).
  - `distance`: Removed the `"km"` suffix and replaced `NULL` with blank space.
  - `duration`: Removed inconsistent time suffixes (`"mins"`, `"minutes"`) and replaced `NULL` with blank space.
  - `cancellation`: Replaced `NULL` with blank space.
- **Altered Data Types**:
  - Converted `pickup_time` to `DATETIME`, `distance` to `FLOAT`, and `duration` to `INT`.

These cleaning steps were essential to ensure accurate and consistent data for analysis.

## üìä Pizza Metrics Solutions

### Example Questions Answered

#### 1. **How many pizzas were ordered?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS num_of_orders 
FROM customer_orders_temp;
```
**Explanation:** This query counts all the rows in the `customer_orders_temp` table. Each row represents one pizza, so the result gives the total number of pizzas ordered.

#### 2. **How many unique customer orders were made?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS num_of_orders 
FROM customer_orders_temp;
```
**Explanation:** This query counts only the unique `order_id` values using `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`. It gives the number of separate customer orders, even if some orders included multiple pizzas.

#### 3. **How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**
```sql
SELECT 
    runner_id, 
    COUNT(order_id) AS num_of_successful_orders 
FROM runner_orders_temp
WHERE distance != 0
GROUP BY runner_id;
```
**Explanation:** This query counts how many orders were successfully delivered by each runner. The `WHERE distance != 0` condition ensures only delivered orders are counted. Results are grouped by each `runner_id` to show the count per runner.

#### 4. **How many of each type of pizza was delivered?**
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        c.order_id, 
        pizza_id, 
        distance 
    FROM customer_orders_temp c
    INNER JOIN runner_orders_temp r
        ON c.order_id = r.order_id
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT 
        pizza_id, 
        COUNT(order_id) AS num_of_pizzas 
    FROM cte
    WHERE distance != 0
    GROUP BY pizza_id
)
SELECT 
    pizza_name, 
    num_of_pizzas 
FROM pizza_names
INNER JOIN cte2 
    ON cte2.pizza_id = pizza_names.pizza_id;
```
**Explanation:**
- First, the query filters for delivered orders by joining `customer_orders_temp` and `runner_orders_temp` and ensuring `distance != 0`.
- Then, it groups the data by `pizza_id` to count how many of each type were delivered.
- Finally, the `pizza_names` table is joined to replace `pizza_id` with the actual pizza names (e.g., Meat Lovers, Vegetarian).


#### 5. **How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        pizza_id, 
        customer_id, 
        COUNT(order_id) AS num_pizza_orders 
    FROM customer_orders_temp
    GROUP BY pizza_id, customer_id
)
SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    pizza_name, 
    num_pizza_orders 
FROM cte c
INNER JOIN pizza_names pn 
    ON c.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```
**Explanation:**
- The query groups data by `pizza_id` and `customer_id` to count how many pizzas of each type were ordered by each customer.
- The `pizza_names` table is joined to display pizza names instead of IDs.
- Results are ordered by `customer_id` for clarity.

#### 6. **What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?**
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        r.order_id, 
        COUNT(pizza_id) AS num_pizzas_delivered_per_order 
    FROM runner_orders_temp r
    INNER JOIN customer_orders_temp c
        ON r.order_id = c.order_id
    WHERE distance != 0
    GROUP BY r.order_id
)
SELECT MAX(num_pizzas_delivered_per_order) AS max_pizzas_delivered 
FROM cte;
```
**Explanation:**
This query calculates the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order.  
- It first counts the number of pizzas per `order_id` where `distance != 0`.
- Then, it uses the `MAX()` function to find the largest count from all the orders.
  
#### 7. **For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?**
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN exclusions = '' AND extras = '' THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END) AS no_change,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN exclusions <> '' OR extras <> '' THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END) AS at_least_1_change
FROM customer_orders_temp c
INNER JOIN runner_orders_temp r 
    ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE distance != 0
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
**Explanation:** 
This query shows how many delivered pizzas had changes and how many didn‚Äôt:  
- **No changes**: Rows where both `exclusions` and `extras` are empty.
- **At least one change**: Rows where either `exclusions` or `extras` has a value.
- Results are grouped by `customer_id` to show counts for each customer.


#### 8. **How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?**
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(r.order_id) AS num_pizzas_delivered 
FROM customer_orders_temp c 
INNER JOIN runner_orders_temp r 
    ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE exclusions <> '' AND extras <> '' AND distance != 0;
```
**Explanation:** This query counts how many pizzas were delivered where customers requested both `exclusions` (ingredients removed) and `extras` (ingredients added). The `distance != 0` condition ensures only delivered orders are counted.


#### 9. **What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?**
```sql
SELECT 
    DATEPART(HOUR, order_time) AS hour_of_the_day, 
    COUNT(order_id) AS num_of_orders 
FROM customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY DATEPART(HOUR, order_time)
ORDER BY 1;
```
**Explanation:** The query extracts the hour from `order_time` using `DATEPART(HOUR, order_time)` and counts the number of pizzas ordered during each hour. Results are grouped by hour and sorted in ascending order.

#### 10. **What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?**
```sql
SELECT 
    FORMAT(DATEADD(DAY, 2, order_time), 'dddd') AS day_of_week, 
    COUNT(order_id) AS total_pizzas_ordered
FROM customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY FORMAT(DATEADD(DAY, 2, order_time), 'dddd') 
ORDER BY 
    MIN(DATEADD(DAY, 2, order_time));
```
**Explanation:**
This query calculates the number of pizzas ordered for each day of the week:  
- `DATEADD(DAY, 2, order_time)` adjusts the week to start from Monday.
- `FORMAT(..., 'dddd')` converts the date into a day name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
- Orders are grouped by day and sorted in chronological order.
