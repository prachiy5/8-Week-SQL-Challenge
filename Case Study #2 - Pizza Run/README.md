## üßπ Data Cleaning Approach

### Why Clean the Data?
The raw data contains issues such as:
- `NULL` or invalid values in critical columns (`exclusions`, `extras`, `distance`, etc.).
- Inconsistent formatting (`km`, `minutes`, etc.).
- Duplicate or repeated records.

### How Was the Data Cleaned?

#### 1. **`customer_orders` Table**
- **Cleaned Columns**:
  - `exclusions` and `extras`: Replaced `NULL` and invalid strings (`'null'`) with blank space (`' '`).
- **Removed Duplicates**:
  - Ensured no duplicate `order_id` rows exist.

#### 2. **`runner_orders` Table**
- **Cleaned Columns**:
  - `pickup_time`: Replaced `NULL` and invalid strings (`'null'`) with blank space (`' '`).
  - `distance`: Removed the `"km"` suffix and replaced `NULL` with blank space.
  - `duration`: Removed inconsistent time suffixes (`"mins"`, `"minutes"`) and replaced `NULL` with blank space.
  - `cancellation`: Replaced `NULL` with blank space.
- **Altered Data Types**:
  - Converted `pickup_time` to `DATETIME`, `distance` to `FLOAT`, and `duration` to `INT`.

These cleaning steps were essential to ensure accurate and consistent data for analysis.

## üìä Pizza Metrics Solutions

### Example Questions Answered

#### 1. **How many pizzas were ordered?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS num_of_orders 
FROM customer_orders_temp;
```
**Explanation:** This query counts all the rows in the `customer_orders_temp` table. Each row represents one pizza, so the result gives the total number of pizzas ordered.

#### 2. **How many unique customer orders were made?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS num_of_orders 
FROM customer_orders_temp;
```
**Explanation:** This query counts only the unique `order_id` values using `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)`. It gives the number of separate customer orders, even if some orders included multiple pizzas.

#### 3. **How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**
```sql
SELECT 
    runner_id, 
    COUNT(order_id) AS num_of_successful_orders 
FROM runner_orders_temp
WHERE distance != 0
GROUP BY runner_id;
```
**Explanation:** This query counts how many orders were successfully delivered by each runner. The `WHERE distance != 0` condition ensures only delivered orders are counted. Results are grouped by each `runner_id` to show the count per runner.

#### 4. **How many of each type of pizza was delivered?**
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        c.order_id, 
        pizza_id, 
        distance 
    FROM customer_orders_temp c
    INNER JOIN runner_orders_temp r
        ON c.order_id = r.order_id
),
cte2 AS (
    SELECT 
        pizza_id, 
        COUNT(order_id) AS num_of_pizzas 
    FROM cte
    WHERE distance != 0
    GROUP BY pizza_id
)
SELECT 
    pizza_name, 
    num_of_pizzas 
FROM pizza_names
INNER JOIN cte2 
    ON cte2.pizza_id = pizza_names.pizza_id;
```
**Explanation:**
- First, the query filters for delivered orders by joining `customer_orders_temp` and `runner_orders_temp` and ensuring `distance != 0`.
- Then, it groups the data by `pizza_id` to count how many of each type were delivered.
- Finally, the `pizza_names` table is joined to replace `pizza_id` with the actual pizza names (e.g., Meat Lovers, Vegetarian).


#### 5. **How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        pizza_id, 
        customer_id, 
        COUNT(order_id) AS num_pizza_orders 
    FROM customer_orders_temp
    GROUP BY pizza_id, customer_id
)
SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    pizza_name, 
    num_pizza_orders 
FROM cte c
INNER JOIN pizza_names pn 
    ON c.pizza_id = pn.pizza_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```
**Explanation:**
- The query groups data by `pizza_id` and `customer_id` to count how many pizzas of each type were ordered by each customer.
- The `pizza_names` table is joined to display pizza names instead of IDs.
- Results are ordered by `customer_id` for clarity.

#### 6. **What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?**
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        r.order_id, 
        COUNT(pizza_id) AS num_pizzas_delivered_per_order 
    FROM runner_orders_temp r
    INNER JOIN customer_orders_temp c
        ON r.order_id = c.order_id
    WHERE distance != 0
    GROUP BY r.order_id
)
SELECT MAX(num_pizzas_delivered_per_order) AS max_pizzas_delivered 
FROM cte;
```
**Explanation:**
This query calculates the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order.  
- It first counts the number of pizzas per `order_id` where `distance != 0`.
- Then, it uses the `MAX()` function to find the largest count from all the orders.
  
#### 7. **For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?**
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN exclusions = '' AND extras = '' THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END) AS no_change,
    SUM(CASE 
        WHEN exclusions <> '' OR extras <> '' THEN 1 
        ELSE 0 
    END) AS at_least_1_change
FROM customer_orders_temp c
INNER JOIN runner_orders_temp r 
    ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE distance != 0
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
**Explanation:** 
This query shows how many delivered pizzas had changes and how many didn‚Äôt:  
- **No changes**: Rows where both `exclusions` and `extras` are empty.
- **At least one change**: Rows where either `exclusions` or `extras` has a value.
- Results are grouped by `customer_id` to show counts for each customer.


#### 8. **How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?**
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(r.order_id) AS num_pizzas_delivered 
FROM customer_orders_temp c 
INNER JOIN runner_orders_temp r 
    ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE exclusions <> '' AND extras <> '' AND distance != 0;
```
**Explanation:** This query counts how many pizzas were delivered where customers requested both `exclusions` (ingredients removed) and `extras` (ingredients added). The `distance != 0` condition ensures only delivered orders are counted.


#### 9. **What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?**
```sql
SELECT 
    DATEPART(HOUR, order_time) AS hour_of_the_day, 
    COUNT(order_id) AS num_of_orders 
FROM customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY DATEPART(HOUR, order_time)
ORDER BY 1;
```
**Explanation:** The query extracts the hour from `order_time` using `DATEPART(HOUR, order_time)` and counts the number of pizzas ordered during each hour. Results are grouped by hour and sorted in ascending order.

#### 10. **What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?**
```sql
SELECT 
    FORMAT(DATEADD(DAY, 2, order_time), 'dddd') AS day_of_week, 
    COUNT(order_id) AS total_pizzas_ordered
FROM customer_orders_temp
GROUP BY FORMAT(DATEADD(DAY, 2, order_time), 'dddd') 
ORDER BY 
    MIN(DATEADD(DAY, 2, order_time));
```
**Explanation:**
This query calculates the number of pizzas ordered for each day of the week:  
- `DATEADD(DAY, 2, order_time)` adjusts the week to start from Monday.
- `FORMAT(..., 'dddd')` converts the date into a day name (e.g., Monday, Tuesday).
- Orders are grouped by day and sorted in chronological order.

        runners.runner_id,
        orders.order_time,
        runners.pickup_time
    FROM customer_orders_temp AS orders
    JOIN runner_orders_temp AS runners
        ON orders.order_id = runners.order_id
    WHERE runners.cancellation = ''
)
SELECT

    CEILING(CAST(AVG(DATEDIFF(SECOND, order_time, pickup_time)) AS FLOAT) / 60) AS avg_min_to_pickup
FROM cte
GROUP BY runner_id;

```
#### 3. **Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?**
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        c.order_id, 
        COUNT(c.pizza_id) AS num_of_pizzas, 
        CEILING(CAST(AVG(DATEDIFF(SECOND, c.order_time, r.pickup_time)) AS FLOAT) / 60) AS avg_time
    FROM customer_orders_temp c
    INNER JOIN runner_orders_temp r 
        ON c.order_id = r.order_id
    WHERE r.pickup_time != 0 
    GROUP BY c.order_id
)
SELECT 
    num_of_pizzas, 
    AVG(avg_time) AS avg_preparation_time
FROM cte
GROUP BY num_of_pizzas
ORDER BY num_of_pizzas;
```
#### 4. **What was the average distance travelled for each customer?**
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        c.order_id, 
        customer_id, 
        distance 
    FROM customer_orders_temp c
    INNER JOIN runner_orders_temp r
        ON c.order_id = r.order_id
)
SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(distance), 2) AS avg_distance_travelled
FROM cte 
WHERE distance != 0
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

#### 5. **What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?**
```sql
SELECT 
    MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) AS diff_between_shortest_and_longest_delivery
FROM runner_orders_temp
WHERE duration != 0;
```
#### 6. **What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?**
```sql
SELECT 
    order_id, 
    runner_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(distance * 60 / duration), 2) AS avg_speed_km_per_h
FROM runner_orders_temp
WHERE distance != 0
GROUP BY order_id, runner_id;
```
#### 7. **What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT 
        runner_id,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN distance != 0 THEN 1 END) AS num_successful_orders,
        COUNT(*) AS num_orders
    FROM runner_orders_temp
    GROUP BY runner_id
)
SELECT 
    runner_id,
    ROUND((CAST(num_successful_orders AS FLOAT) * 100) / num_orders, 2) AS percentage_successful_orders
FROM cte;
```
