# Campaign Analysis ðŸ“¢

In this section, we analyze campaign performance and user behavior by generating a summary table for each visit and deriving insights from the data. The goal is to understand how campaigns influenced user engagement and purchases.

## Campaign Summary Table Creation ðŸ›’

### SQL Code:
```sql
WITH visit_data AS (
    SELECT 
        e.visit_id,
        u.user_id,
        MIN(e.event_time) AS visit_start_time,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Page View' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS page_views,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Add to Cart' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS cart_adds,
        MAX(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Ad Impression' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS impression,
        COUNT(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Ad Click' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS click,
        STRING_AGG(CASE WHEN ei.event_name = 'Add to Cart' THEN ph.page_name ELSE NULL END, ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY e.sequence_number) AS cart_products
    FROM events e
    LEFT JOIN event_identifier ei ON e.event_type = ei.event_type
    LEFT JOIN page_hierarchy ph ON e.page_id = ph.page_id
    LEFT JOIN users u ON e.cookie_id = u.cookie_id
    GROUP BY e.visit_id, u.user_id
),
campaign_mapping AS (
    SELECT 
        vd.visit_id,
        vd.user_id,
        vd.visit_start_time,
        vd.page_views,
        vd.cart_adds,
        vd.purchase,
        vd.impression,
        vd.click,
        vd.cart_products,
        ci.campaign_name
    FROM visit_data vd
    LEFT JOIN campaign_identifier ci 
        ON vd.visit_start_time BETWEEN ci.start_date AND ci.end_date
)
SELECT *
INTO visit_summary 
FROM campaign_mapping;
```

### Sample Output:

### 1. **Ad Impressions Drive Higher Conversions**

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    campaign_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN impression > 0 THEN user_id ELSE NULL END) AS users_with_impressions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN impression = 0 THEN user_id ELSE NULL END) AS users_without_impressions,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN impression > 0 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) /
          NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN impression > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0), 2) AS purchase_rate_with_impressions,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN impression = 0 AND purchase = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) /
          NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN impression = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0), 2) AS purchase_rate_without_impressions
FROM visit_summary
