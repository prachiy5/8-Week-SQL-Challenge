## Questions Addressed üñäÔ∏è

### Using a single SQL query, create a new output table with the following details:

- **How many times was each product viewed?**
- **How many times was each product added to a cart?**
- **How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?**
- **How many times was each product purchased?**
