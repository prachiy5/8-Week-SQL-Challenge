## üîç **Case Study Questions**

### **1. Data Cleansing Steps**
Create a cleaned version of the `weekly_sales` table, adding new calculated columns:
- Convert `week_date` to a `DATE` format.
- Add `week_number`, `month_number`, and `calendar_year` columns.
- Create new columns: `age_band`, `demographic`, and `avg_transaction`.

### **2. Data Exploration**
Answer exploratory questions such as:
- What day of the week is used for `week_date`?
- Identify missing `week_number` ranges.
- Calculate total sales, transactions, and percentage breakdowns by various dimensions.

### **3. Before & After Analysis**
Analyze the impact of sustainable packaging changes:
- Compare total sales for the **4 weeks** and **12 weeks** before and after the baseline date (`2020-06-15`).
- Compare these sales metrics with the corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019.

### **4. Bonus Question**
Identify areas of the business most negatively impacted during the **12-week period** after the change, broken down by:
- `region`
- `platform`
- `age_band`
- `demographic`
- `customer_type`
